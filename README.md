## Installation 

### Prerequisites

The Belugas Ruby CLI is distributed and run as a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/icalialabs/belugas-linguist/) image, so you only need to have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and running on your machine.

### Setup

Fire up your terminal and run: 

```console
docker pull icalialabs/belugas-linguist:latest
```

And that's it! 

## Usage

Here's where the magic begins, first of all in your terminal go to the project directory you want to analyze:

```console
cd code/path_to_project/
```

The project must be a git project, since linguist gets lots of information from git files. Once in the project, just execute the following command: 

```console
docker run \
  --interactive --tty --rm \
  --volume "$PWD":/code \
  icalialabs/belugas-linguist
```

And voil√°! The terminal will stream a json output for each of the features detected in the following format:

```
[{
  "type": "feature",
  "name": "Ruby",
  "description": "The application uses Ruby code",
  "content": Content,
  "categories": ["Language"],
  "cue_locations": [all_files_from_ruby],
  "engines": ["github-linguist"],
  "meta": {
    "ratio": 0.5
    "total_files": 50
  }
},
{
  "type": "feature",
  "name": "CoffeeScript",
  "description": "The application uses Coffee",
  "content": Content,
  "categories": ["Language"],
  "cue_locations": [Location],
  "engines": ["github-linguist", "beluga-coffee"]
}
]
```
